## Neural Machine Translation

Machine Translation Framework.

Machine Translation, Image Caption, Text Summary, Music Generation, ChatBot all could be trained by this model.

Environment:

Tensorflow: >= 1.2

Framework Points:

+ Seq2Seq by tensorflow
    + Encoder
    + Decoder
    + Optimizer
    + weighted crossentropy
+ Attention Model in tensorflow.
+ Stack based Model
+ Data Pipeline in tensorflow.

TO DO:

[ ] Sampled Softmax
[ ] a convenient GUI
[ ] CNN based Encoder.

e.g:

 '知识就是力量' ==> 'Knowledge is power'
